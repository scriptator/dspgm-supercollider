This repo contains scripts written in Supercollider created during the course Digital Signal Processing and Generative Music at TU Wien 2018.

## Four Chord Composer
The script `4ChordComposer.scd` creates a song based on chord progressions which are typical in modern pop music.
Nearly all parameters, such as bpm, scale and key are defined by randomness.
The rhythm is created by shuffling an array of note values and the corresponding melody is chosen probabilisticly,
where the notes of the current chord have a higher weight than the other notes.

Some examples of how this sounds can be found on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/scriptator/sets/four-chord-composer).

## Twelve-tone music
The file `12ton.scd` contains an exercise regarding twelve-tone music.

## Downloaded
Things in the folder `downloaded` have not been written by me but are some cool things which I found on the internet.
